embedding arbitrary treescope-renderable objects or treescope-compatible styles

  Behavior depends on the type of `value`:

  * If ``value`` is an instance of `TreescopeFigure`, unwraps the

  * If ``value`` is a string, returns a rendering of that string.
  * If ``value`` has a ``_repr_html_`` method (but isn't an instance of
    `TreescopeFigure`), returns an embedded iframe with the given HTML
    contents.
  * Otherwise, renders the value using the default treescope renderer, but
    strips off any top-level comments / copy button annotations.

  The typical use is to provide helper constructors for containers to allow
  rendering lots of different objects in the "obvious" way.
